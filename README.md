Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your laptop. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open your git bash and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/<user_name>/<repository_link>.git
```

where `<user_name>` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the `Git-Github-Tutorial` repository on GitHub to your laptop.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your machine(if you are not already there):

```
cd Git-Github-Tutorial
```

Now create a branch using the `git branch` command:

```
git branch <branch_name>
```

For example:

```
git branch feature
```

To switch to new branch use the command `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout <branch_name>
```

For example:

```
git checkout feature
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now changes directory to the `Data` folder.

```
cd Data
```

Now create a text file using the `touch` command:

```
touch <file_name>.txt
```

For example:

```
touch Deepanshu.txt
```

Now open the newly created text file in a `text editor` or `VS Code`, enter your information. After final edit save the file.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Here in the above command `.` , is used to track all changes in the current directory

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "<write a message, describing what changes you've made>"
```

For example:

```
git commit -m "added Deepanshu.txt"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request, by clicking on `Create pull request` button.

<img style="float: right;" src="./assets/submitPR.png" alt="submit pull request" />
